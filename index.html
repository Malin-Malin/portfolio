            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!<br>
                Here you’ll find a collection of the creative work I’ve completed during my first
                year as a front-end development student at Noroff. This site showcases everything from wireframes and
                design mockups to fully coded websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
                I'm someone who values structure, creativity, and functional design. Feel free to explore my work and
                get in touch if you want to learn more!</p>

                            clearly, and stay organized, especially under pressure. These are skills I carry with me

                        <p>Alongside my job, I study full-time at Noroff and have just completed my first year in
                            front-end development. Learning to code while applying it directly in real projects has been
                            both challenging and incredibly rewarding.</p>

                        <p>I enjoy finding the balance between logic and creativity. I thrive when working with clean,
                            structured code – but I’m just as passionate about crafting visual layouts that feel
                            beautiful, intuitive, and user-friendly.</p>

                        <p>RainyDays was my first front-end project: a fictional webshop for rain jackets built with
                            HTML and CSS. (JavaScript was added later).<br>
                            I focused on clean structure, responsive design, and user-friendly navigation. It marked the
                            start of my coding journey
                            Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come since then – but RainyDays will always be a
                            milestone that
                            marked the start of my journey into web development.</p>

                            accessibility, using only HTML and CSS. It was a great challenge that helped me grow in both
                            creativity and coding confidence.</p>

                            Makerspace. The site includes multiple pages, a blog system, and forms – all built using
                            HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project brought together everything I’ve learned so far, with
                            a strong focus on structure, usability, and visual consistency.</p>
